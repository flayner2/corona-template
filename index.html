        <h1>Symptoms of Coronavirus</h1>

        <p>
          Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms.
          You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are
          similar to a cold or flu.
        </p>

        <p>
          Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19.
          This is the longest known infectious period for this disease. We are
          currently investigating if the virus can be trasmitted to others if
          someone is not showing symptoms. While experts believe that it is
          possible, it is considered less common.
        </p>

        <p>
          Symptoms have included:
        </p>

        <div id="symptom-list">
          <ul>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Runny Nose</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Throat Pain</li>
            <li>Shaking Chills</li>
            <li>Dypsnoea</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>In severe cases, infection can lead to death.</p>
